When my I started building Reblox, I really thought it would be a simple project. DAMN was I wrong. There are just so many things that you can fit into a web dashboard, I never thought I'd be working on it so much months later. There are so many performance optimizations to do, like SQL queries that need rewriting, database management tasks, etc. It's gotten to the point of being a bit annoying, like that book that killed off your main character but you want to see how it ends. I'm worried mostly about costs and security, but honestly how much security does a Roblox game need? Price points are a major piece of contention in my head too, how the fuck do we scale this, stuff like that. The end goal is definitely to make money, but I'm not sure if that's realistic. It's definitely a good product (not great), and there's an audience, but how do we get it to the audience? We haven't gotten any signups or subscriptions at this point, and I'm a bit worried. There are 4 new users, but non of them have a subscription. IDK, let's see what happens.
