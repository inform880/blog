Here are a list of interesting templates/boilerplate projects that are useful for different contexts. 

**[Netlify CMS with Next.JS Blog Template](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/nextjs/)**

[](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/nextjs/)This is what this blog is using! This template is great for simple blogs, and great for customization.

**[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)**

The "web's most popular front-end template" is a great starting point for developers learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as developing non framework websites. 

**[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)**

The best way to get started with React, and a great way to get started with SPAs.



I'll be adding more as time goes on!
